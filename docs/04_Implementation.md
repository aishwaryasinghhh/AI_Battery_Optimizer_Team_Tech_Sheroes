# Implementation Details

- **Data Collection:** Usage and battery statistics collected via JavaScript APIs.  
- **Training:** Lightweight ML models in TensorFlow.js trained on-device.  
- **Prediction:** Model predicts next likely app and optimizes resources.  
- **Optimization:** Adjusts FPS, brightness, and power for real-time savings.  
- **Analytics:** Chart.js provides interactive visual reports of performance.  

All logic is packaged in a **PWA** for easy cross-platform deployment.
